# EK80_Sensors
Raw EK80 data used for the paper "Improved visualization of Hydroacoustic Plumes Using the Split-Beam Aperture Coherence" 

The data format is binary .raw files, with complex-valued data stored for each of the three split beam sectors 
(the transceiver used in this study has three sectors, others have 4, and the method is equally applicable in either case).
 MATLAB code for reading the EK80 .raw format is now publically available at https://bitbucket.org/echoanalysis/esp3/overview.
